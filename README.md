## Front-end Challenge

### Requirements

Build a front-end component based on the [designs previewed here](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/59d45ae164ae4f837e3366d5).

### Design assets

The .sketch source is provided inside of the designs folder.
If you don't have the [Sketch application](https://www.sketchapp.com/), request access to the [project on Zeplin](zpl.io/2EmoJ1Y) instead.

### Installation

**The workflow requires Node >=8.11.x**

Install using the following command:

`npm install`

The front-end node workflow for watching for changes and compiling the assets is already setup, and you can use it after installing the npm project with the following command:

`npm run dev`
